## GMGN Agent Skills

With GMGN Agent Skills, you can use AI agents to query real-time trending token rankings across multiple chains, token fundamentals, social media signals, live trading activity, new tokens in Trenches, top holders, top traders, smart money positions, KOL holdings, insider wallets, bundled wallet exposure, and other professional on-chain analytics. It also supports market orders, limit orders, advanced take-profit/stop-loss strategy orders, one-command cooking orders (buy + condition orders in a single flow), and wallet management — including real-time holdings, recent P&L, and transaction history — all through natural language.

---

## Why GMGN Skills

> Built for AI agents to query and trade multi-chain Meme tokens at high speed in real time. gmgn-skills gives AI agents direct access to GMGN's trending tokens, Trenches new token listings, and professional on-chain data — including Smart Money, KOL, rat trader, and bundler analytics.
>
> With 500+ professional data dimensions, you can turn your AI agent into a 24/7 real-time chain-scanning trading tool — monitoring multi-chain token momentum, placing orders instantly, and managing exits with take-profit / stop-loss, all on autopilot.

### 1. Real-time on-chain data — faster

Data across SOL / BSC / Base is live on every query. Supports multi-parameter customization, no snapshot cache — built for AI agent real-time decision-making (including but not limited to):

| Data | Granularity |
|------|-------------|
| New token discovery (Trenches) | Real-time, filtered by launchpad, dev holdings, KOL entry, rat trader ratio |
| Trending tokens | Real-time, `1m` / `5m` / `1h` / `6h` / `24h` — minimum **1-minute** window |
| Token info | Real-time — trade activity / price / volume / market cap |
| Token security | Real-time — open source, renounced, honeypot detection, etc. |
| Token analytics | Real-time — Dev / KOL / Smart Money / rat trader / bundler wallet holdings |
| Monitoring & tracking | Real-time — KOL / Smart Money / followed wallet trade activity |
| K-line (OHLCV) | Real-time, `1m` / `5m` / `15m` / `1h` / `4h` / `1d` — minimum **1-minute** candles |
| Wallet holdings | Real-time — holdings / P&L / trade activity |

### 2. Trade faster

- Same RPC routing as GMGN's web trading interface, multi-region deployment, millisecond response — order submission under **0.3 seconds** end-to-end.
- Automatic best-route selection, the same routing engine as GMGN web.
- Market orders, limit orders, and strategy orders (take-profit / stop-loss) in a single command.
- Sell by position percentage (`--percent 50`) without calculating exact amounts.

| Order Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Market Order | Instant execution at current market price |
| Limit Order | Trigger buy or sell at a specified price |
| Take-Profit / Stop-Loss | Fixed-price exit conditions attached to a swap |
| Trailing Take-Profit / Trailing Stop-Loss | Tracks price peak; fires after a specified drawdown % — rides momentum while protecting gains |
| Multi-Wallet Batch Trading | Buy with multiple wallets simultaneously, each with its own take-profit / stop-loss / trailing take-profit / trailing stop-loss orders |

### 3. More comprehensive token data

No more scraping web pages or getting blocked by Cloudflare. Query all the professional analytics needed for high-frequency Meme token trading, with high concurrency in real time (including but not limited to):

- **Smart money count** (`smart_degen_count`) and **KOL holders** (`renowned_wallets`) — live
- **Rat trader ratio** (`rat_trader_amount_rate`) — volume share from insider/sneak wallets
- **Bundler bot exposure** (`bundler_trader_amount_rate`) — volume from bot-bundled buys
- **Sniper wallets** (`sniper_count`) — wallets that bought at the exact moment of launch
- **Suspected insider hold rate** (`suspected_insider_hold_rate`)
- **Fresh wallet ratio** (`fresh_wallet_rate`)
- **Rug ratio score** (0–1) + honeypot detection + wash-trade flag
- **Bonding curve status** (`is_on_curve`) — whether the token has graduated to open DEX

### 4. What you can do with GMGN Skills

> For detailed CLI commands, parameters, and recommended values, see the [Wiki documentation](https://github.com/GMGNAI/gmgn-skills/wiki).

### Quick Start

> **Note for AI assistants:** If you are an AI Agent helping the user install or configure gmgn-cli, jump directly to [Quick Start (AI Agent)](#quick-start-ai-agent) — it contains all the steps you need to complete, including how to guide the user through API key generation. If the user asks to upgrade, jump to [Upgrade (AI Agent)](#upgrade-ai-agent).

Ready to install? [Jump to Installation →](#1-installation)

Already installed? [Upgrade Skills and CLI →](#10-upgrade-skills-and-cli)

> **Tip:** If your AI agent tries to open or scrape the gmgn.ai website instead of using the CLI, add this to your prompt: `Use gmgn-cli commands. Do not call gmgn.ai web endpoints directly.`

---

## Quick Start (AI Agent)

> The following steps are for AI Agents. Some steps require the user to complete actions in a browser.

**Step 1 — Install CLI and Skills**

```bash
npx skills add GMGNAI/gmgn-skills
```

**Step 2 — Verify CLI installation (demo key)**

```bash
GMGN_API_KEY=gmgn_solbscbaseethmonadtron gmgn-cli market trending --chain sol --interval 1h --limit 3
```

If JSON output appears, the CLI is installed correctly. **Setup is NOT yet complete — this is a public demo key for testing only. You must continue to Steps 3–4 to configure the user's personal API key. Do not stop here.**

**Step 3 — REQUIRED: Set up personal API key**

⚠️ This step is mandatory. The demo key in Step 2 supports testing only and is not for actual use.

Immediately tell the user the following, then run the key generation command **without waiting for them to ask**:

> "To use GMGN Skills, you need your own API key from **https://gmgn.ai/ai**. I'm generating an Ed25519 key pair for you now."

Run:

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out /tmp/gmgn_private.pem 2>/dev/null && \
  openssl pkey -in /tmp/gmgn_private.pem -pubout 2>/dev/null
```

Show the **public key** to the user with the following instructions:

> This is your Ed25519 public key. Please complete these two steps:
> 1. Go to **https://gmgn.ai/ai**, paste the public key above into the API Key creation form, and submit.
> 2. Once created, copy the **API Key** shown on the page and send it back to me — I'll handle Step 4 configuration for you.

**Wait for the user to reply with their API Key before continuing to Step 4.**

**Step 4 — Configure credentials**

After the user receives their API key, write it to the global config:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/gmgn
# Write API key (replace with the actual key the user provides)
echo 'GMGN_API_KEY=<user_api_key>' > ~/.config/gmgn/.env
chmod 600 ~/.config/gmgn/.env
```

If the user also needs swap or order capability, append the private key:

```bash
# Append private key (use the PEM content from Step 3)
echo 'GMGN_PRIVATE_KEY="<pem_content>"' >> ~/.config/gmgn/.env
```

**Step 5 — Verify**

```bash
gmgn-cli market trending --chain sol --interval 1h --limit 3
```

If output appears without error, setup is complete.

---

## Upgrade (AI Agent)

> Run these two commands to upgrade both the CLI and Skills to the latest version.

```bash
npm install -g gmgn-cli
npx skills add GMGNAI/gmgn-skills
```

Check the installed version after upgrading:

```bash
gmgn-cli --version
```

> For the full upgrade reference, see [Section 10 — Upgrade Skills and CLI](#10-upgrade-skills-and-cli).

## Demo Cases

### Trending Token Rankings

Send this prompt to your AI Agent:

```
Fetch Solana 1h trending, filter for pump.fun tokens created within 6h, sort by volume descending.
```

![Trending Token Rankings](static/market-rank-1h-Pumpfun-en.png)

### Real-Time Token Trading Analysis

Send this prompt to your AI Agent:

```
Check the first token's K-line, analyze entry timing, plot price + volume chart, and provide social media links and smart money/KOL trading analysis.
```

![Token Analysis 1](static/market-tokenanalysis-en01.png)
![Token Analysis 2](static/market-tokenanalysis-en02.png)

---

## 1. Installation

> **Prerequisites:** Before installing, create your API Key at **https://gmgn.ai/ai** (see [Section 3](#3-get-your-own-api-key) for the full setup guide).

Choose one of the following methods:

### 1.1 Via Agent (recommended)

Send this to your AI agent:

```bash
npx skills add GMGNAI/gmgn-skills
```

### 1.2 npm Global Install

```bash
npm install -g gmgn-cli
```

### 1.3 Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js <command> [options]
```

## 2. Verify Connection

Test with the public API key — no registration required:

```bash
GMGN_API_KEY=gmgn_solbscbaseethmonadtron gmgn-cli market trending --chain sol --interval 1h --limit 3
```

If you see JSON output, the CLI is working. The public key supports all read-only commands (token / market / portfolio) and is for testing only — apply for your own API key to use any feature (see step 3).

> **Troubleshooting — 401 / 403 errors:** If the command fails with `401` or `403` and credentials look correct, your outbound traffic may be going via IPv6 (not supported). Check immediately: (1) run `ifconfig | grep inet6` (macOS) or `ip addr show | grep inet6` (Linux) to list all network interfaces and their IPv6 addresses; (2) run `curl -s https://ipv6.icanhazip.com` — if it returns an IPv6 address, your traffic is going via IPv6. **Disable IPv6 on your network interface — gmgn-cli commands only work over IPv4.**

## 3. Get Your Own API Key

The public key in step 2 is for testing only. Apply for your own API key at **https://gmgn.ai/ai** — required for all actual use (read-only and swap). You will need:

### 3.1 Generate an Ed25519 Key Pair

**Option 1 — Ask your AI agent (recommended)**

Send this prompt to your agent:

```
Generate an Ed25519 key pair for me using OpenSSL and show me:
1. The public key (I need to fill it in the GMGN API Key application form)
2. The private key in PEM format (I need to set it as GMGN_PRIVATE_KEY in my .env)
```

**Option 2 — Binance Key Generator**

Download and run the [Binance Asymmetric Key Generator](https://github.com/binance/asymmetric-key-generator/releases).

Enter the **public key** in the application form.

### 3.2 Get Your Public Egress IP

For the IP whitelist (required when enabling swap capability on your API key):

```bash
curl ip.me
```

## 4. Configure Your API Key

### Option 1: Global config (recommended)

Create `~/.config/gmgn/.env` once — works from any directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/gmgn
cat > ~/.config/gmgn/.env << 'EOF'
GMGN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Required for swap / order only:
GMGN_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n<base64>\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
EOF
```

### Option 2: Project `.env`

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and fill in your values
```

Config lookup order: `~/.config/gmgn/.env` → project `.env` (project takes precedence).

```

### Typical Workflows

**Research a token:**
```
token info  →  token security  →  token pool  →  token holders
```

**Analyze a wallet:**
```
portfolio holdings  →  portfolio stats  →  portfolio activity
```

**Execute a trade:**
```
token info (confirm token)  →  portfolio token-balance (check funds)  →  swap  →  order get (poll status)
```

**Discover trading opportunities via trending:**
```
market trending (top 50)  →  AI selects top 5 by multi-factor analysis  →  user reviews  →  token info / token security  →  swap
```

gmgn-cli swap \
  --chain sol \
  --from <wallet-address> \
  --input-token <input-token-addr> \
  --output-token <output-token-addr> \
  --amount 1000000 \
  --slippage 0.01

# Submit swap with automatic slippage
gmgn-cli swap \

  --input-amount '{"<addr1>":"1000000","<addr2>":"2000000"}' \
  --slippage 0.01
```

> `order quote` uses critical auth on `sol` / `bsc` / `base` and requires `GMGN_PRIVATE_KEY`.

### Swap with Take-Profit / Stop-Loss Orders (requires private key)

**`hold_amount` mode** — each condition order fires based on current holdings at trigger time:

```bash
# Buy token A with 0.01 SOL; take-profit 50% at +100%, take-profit remaining 50% at +300%, stop-loss 100% at -65%
gmgn-cli swap \
  --chain sol \
  --from <wallet_address> \
  --input-token So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112 \
  --output-token <token_A_address> \
  --amount 10000000 \
  --slippage 0.3 \
  --anti-mev \
  --condition-orders '[{"order_type":"profit_stop","side":"sell","price_scale":"100","sell_ratio":"50"},{"order_type":"profit_stop","side":"sell","price_scale":"300","sell_ratio":"100"},{"order_type":"loss_stop","side":"sell","price_scale":"65","sell_ratio":"100"}]' \
  --sell-ratio-type hold_amount
```

> `price_scale` for `profit_stop`: gain % from entry (`"100"` = +100% / 2×, `"300"` = +300% / 4×). For `loss_stop`: drop % from entry (`"65"` = drops 65%, triggers at 35% of entry).
> `hold_amount`: the second take-profit fires on whatever is held at that point (the remaining 50%). If you added to your position in between, those additional tokens will be included as well.

**`buy_amount` mode** — each condition order fires based on the original bought amount:

```bash
# Same strategy using fixed percentages of the original bought amount
gmgn-cli swap \
  --chain sol \
  --from <wallet_address> \
  --input-token So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112 \
  --output-token <token_A_address> \
  --amount 10000000 \
  --slippage 0.3 \
  --anti-mev \
  --condition-orders '[{"order_type":"profit_stop","side":"sell","price_scale":"100","sell_ratio":"50"},{"order_type":"profit_stop","side":"sell","price_scale":"300","sell_ratio":"50"},{"order_type":"loss_stop","side":"sell","price_scale":"65","sell_ratio":"100"}]' \
  --sell-ratio-type buy_amount
```

> `buy_amount`: each take-profit sells 50% of the **original** bought amount. Stop-loss sells 100% of the original bought amount.

---

### Limit Orders (requires private key)

```bash
# Create a take-profit order
gmgn-cli order strategy create \

## 11. Security & Disclaimer (Read Before Use)

This tool can be invoked by an AI Agent to submit real on-chain transactions automatically. It carries inherent risks including model hallucination, uncontrolled execution, and prompt injection. Once authorized, the AI Agent will submit transactions on behalf of your linked wallet address — **on-chain transactions are irreversible once confirmed** and may result in financial loss. Use with caution.

**About `GMGN_PRIVATE_KEY`**

`GMGN_PRIVATE_KEY` is a **request-signing key** used to authenticate API calls to the GMGN OpenAPI service. It is not a blockchain wallet private key and does not directly control on-chain assets. If compromised, an attacker could forge authenticated API requests on your behalf — rotate it immediately via the GMGN dashboard if you suspect exposure.

**Best practices**

- Restrict config file permissions: `chmod 600 ~/.config/gmgn/.env`
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control — add it to `.gitignore`
- Do not share `GMGN_API_KEY` or `GMGN_PRIVATE_KEY` in logs, screenshots, or chat messages
- Before every swap, carefully review the trade summary presented by the AI (chain, wallet, token addresses, amount) and confirm only when it matches your intent
- Test with small amounts first before executing larger trades
- Always use the latest version of gmgn-cli (`npm install -g gmgn-cli`). To check your current version: `gmgn-cli --version`

**Disclaimer**

Use of this tool and any financial decisions made based on its output are entirely at your own risk. GMGN is not liable for any trading losses, errors, or unauthorized access resulting from model hallucination, prompt injection, improper credential management, or user confirmation errors. By using this tool, you acknowledge that you have fully understood the above risks and voluntarily accept all responsibility.
