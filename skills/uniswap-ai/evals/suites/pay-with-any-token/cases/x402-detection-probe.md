# x402 Detection Probe

You are a developer who received this HTTP 402 response from a premium API you
are trying to call. The 402 body is below. Help me understand what's happening
and what I need to do next.

```json

    {

My wallet address is 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C9B5927BB7C789. I have 100
