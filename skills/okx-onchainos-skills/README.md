## Prerequisites

All skills require OKX API credentials. Apply at [OKX Developer Portal](https://web3.okx.com/onchain-os/dev-portal).

Recommended: create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
OKX_API_KEY="your-api-key"
OKX_SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"
OKX_PASSPHRASE="your-passphrase"
```

**Security warning**: Never commit `.env` to git (add it to `.gitignore`) and never expose credentials in logs, screenshots, or chat messages.

## Skill Workflows

The skills work together in typical DeFi flows:

**Search and Buy**: `okx-dex-token` (find token) -> `okx-wallet-portfolio` (check funds) -> `okx-dex-swap` (execute trade)

**Portfolio Overview**: `okx-wallet-portfolio` (holdings) -> `okx-dex-token` (enrich with analytics) -> `okx-dex-market` (price charts)

**Market Research**: `okx-dex-token` (trending/rankings) -> `okx-dex-market` (candles/history) -> `okx-dex-swap` (trade)

**Swap and Broadcast**: `okx-dex-swap` (get tx data) -> sign locally -> `okx-onchain-gateway` (broadcast) -> `okx-onchain-gateway` (track order)

**Pre-flight Check**: `okx-onchain-gateway` (estimate gas) -> `okx-onchain-gateway` (simulate tx) -> `okx-onchain-gateway` (broadcast) -> `okx-onchain-gateway` (track order)

**Full Trading Flow**: `okx-dex-token` (search) -> `okx-dex-market` (price/chart) -> `okx-wallet-portfolio` (check balance) -> `okx-dex-swap` (get tx) -> `okx-onchain-gateway` (simulate + broadcast + track)

**Leaderboard → Research → Trade**: `okx-dex-signal` (top traders by PnL/win rate) -> `okx-dex-token` (token analytics) -> `okx-dex-swap` (execute trade)

**Follow Smart Money**: `okx-dex-signal` (KOL/smart money buys) -> `okx-dex-token` (token details + holder cluster) -> `okx-dex-market` (price chart) -> `okx-dex-swap` (trade)

## Install CLI

### Shell Script (macOS / Linux)

Auto-detects your platform, downloads the latest **stable** release, verifies SHA256 checksum, and installs to `~/.local/bin`:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okx/onchainos-skills/main/install.sh | sh
```

To install the latest **beta** version (includes pre-releases):

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okx/onchainos-skills/main/install.sh | sh -s -- --beta
```

> **Note:** Beta versions (e.g., `v2.0.0-beta.0`) are opt-in only. The default installer and all skill auto-updates always use the latest stable release. Running without `--beta` will never downgrade a beta installation whose base version is ahead of the latest stable.

### PowerShell (Windows)

Auto-detects your platform, downloads the latest **stable** release, verifies SHA256 checksum, and installs to `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin`:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okx/onchainos-skills/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

To install the latest **beta** version (includes pre-releases):

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okx/onchainos-skills/main/install.ps1))) --beta
```

> **Note:** The same beta/stable rules apply — default installs always use the latest stable release, and `--beta` is opt-in only.

## MCP Server

The `onchainos` CLI doubles as a native MCP server exposing tools to any MCP-compatible client.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user onchainos-cli onchainos mcp
```
