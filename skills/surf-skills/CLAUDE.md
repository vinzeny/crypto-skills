## Prerequisites

Install the Surf CLI:

Follow the installation guide at https://agents.asksurf.ai/docs/cli/introduction

```bash
surf list-operations           # verify: lists all available commands
```

## Key Files

- **`skills/surf/SKILL.md`** -- Agent-discoverable skill for all surf CLI commands. Contains recipes for common research tasks, parameter conventions, command index, and credit costs.

## Adding New Endpoints

No surf-skills changes needed. Add the endpoint in hermod — the surf CLI discovers it automatically from the updated OpenAPI spec. `surf list-operations` will show the new command. Update `skills/surf/SKILL.md` if the new endpoint belongs to a new domain or changes existing recipes.
