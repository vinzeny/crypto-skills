## Installation

Install with [Vercel's Skills CLI](https:/skills.sh):

```bash
npx skills add coinbase/agentic-wallet-skills
```

## Usage

Skills are automatically available once installed. The agent will use them when relevant tasks are detected.

**Examples:**

```text
Sign-in to my wallet with me@email.com
```

```text
Send 10 USDC to barmstrong.eth
```

## Contributing

To add a new skill:

1. Create a folder in `./skills/` with a lowercase, hyphenated name
2. Add a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and instructions

See the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) for the complete format.

### Updating the `awal` version

All skills pin a specific version of the `awal` CLI. When a new version is published to npm, run:

```bash
# Make sure you're using Node v22+
node ./scripts/bump-awal.js
```

This fetches the latest version from the npm registry and updates all skill files automatically.
